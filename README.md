#  Trajectory grapher
This program is written in Python 3.4 and uses the Tkinter and Matplotlib modules to create a GUI and graph to plot the trajectory of a projectile.

The projectile acts on an X-Y plane and is not affected by any forces (Essentially if it were launched in space). To calculate the values for the graph points I used the simple kinematic equations (SUVAT).
