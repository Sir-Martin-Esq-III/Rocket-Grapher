#  Trajectory grapher (possible Year-13-project-PROTOTYPE)
This program uses Tkinter and Matplotlib to create a GUI and graph to plot the trajectory of a projectile.
I did not use any fancy physics, I only used SUVAT equations to get the values.
For whatever reason it goes wrong on monitors that are not 1920X1080 or >.
I might try to fix it if I have time, else what are you doing without atleast a 1080P monitor
