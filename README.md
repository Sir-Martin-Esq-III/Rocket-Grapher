#  Rocket Grapher
This program is written in Python 3.4 and uses the Tkinter and Matplotlib modules to create a GUI and graph to plot various graphs of a rocket being launched.

The rocket acts only on the X-Y plane and only uses the kinematic equations and Newtons laws of motion.(Some more complex physics is not computed such as turning forces and horizontal resistive forces)

What I plan to add:

  *Complex physics 

  *Different stages

  *Different graphs(Velocity-Time, Displacement-Time and others)
