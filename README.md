#  Rocket Grapher
This program is written in Python 3.4 and uses the Tkinter and Matplotlib modules to create a GUI and graph to plot various graphs of a rocket being launched.

The rocket acts only on the X-Y plane and (for now) only uses the simple kinematic equations and does not consider other variables such as engine thrust or mass.

What I plan to add:

*Animated graphs

*Complex physics 

*Different stages

*Different graphs(Velocity-Time, Displacement-Time and others)
