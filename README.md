#  Rocket Grapher
This program is written in Python 3.4 and uses the Tkinter and Matplotlib modules to create a GUI and graph to plot various graphs of a rocket being launched based on user input

The rocket acts only on the X-Y plane and uses Eulers method and newtons laws of motion. However the program does not take into account horizontal resistive forces or turning forces (and some other things I don't even know exist)

Things I want to add
* Get the save function to work
* Include horizontal forces
* Improve speed (It really needs it...)
